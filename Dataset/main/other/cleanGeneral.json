I live in Sweden which is also where I was born and raised. I've been on YouTube much longer than now, my very first username was Evilvoiceboy where I used to create many varied videos that involved many cartoons from Cartoon Network e.g. Ed, Edd 'n Eddy, Foster's home for imaginary friends but especially Robotboy. I'm afraid that that account has shut down now which sucks because I wasn't able to save my videos before they would die. But then I created Robotboyvids (which is still active at the moment but it's using my old e-mail which I can't access) which I created for the purpose of making videos with Robotoby. I know that Robotboy isn't or wasn't the best cartoon on earth I admit that it has some flaws but I wouldn't call it a big fat rip-off of other cartoons which some people are making it out. If hopefully I would be able to do this I would try to make a reboot to the show and save it from the negativity", "descriptionCharCount": 814, "keywords": ["RobotboyCentury"], "keywordsCount": 1, "topicCategories": ["Music", "Entertainment", "Film"], "topicCount": 3, "featuredChannels": 0, "featuredChannelsCount": 0, "country": "SE", "madeForKids": false, "publishedAt": null}

Think Pink!\n\nNew episodes of The Pink Panther (1993) will be uploaded every Monday, Thursday, and Saturday!\n\nIn 1964, this pink-inked feline slinked onto the opening credits of Blake Edwards' caper film by the same name and threatened to steal the entire show. Sleek, sophisticated and witty, the animation, produced by Friz Freleng and David H. DePatie, was a stylish departure from its contemporaries...and an instant hit. A subsequent short film, The Pink Phink, would go on to win* an Oscar\u00ae and spawn a celebrated series of six-minute cartoons featuring the sly cat.", "descriptionCharCount": 514, "keywords": ["Pink", "Panther", "Classic", "Cartoons"], "keywordsCount": 4, "topicCategories": ["Television_program", "Film", "Entertainment"], "topicCount": 3, "featuredChannels": 0, "featuredChannelsCount": 0, "country": "N/A", "madeForKids": true, "publishedAt": null}
